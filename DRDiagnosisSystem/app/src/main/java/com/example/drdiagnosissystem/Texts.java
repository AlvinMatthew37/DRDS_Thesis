These blood vessels, which are thin and weak and prone to bleeding, cause scar tissue to form inside the eye. This scar tissue can pull the retina away from the back of your eye, causing retinal detachment. A detached retina typically results in blurriness, reduced field of vision, and even permanent blindness."};
